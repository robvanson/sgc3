*SpeakGoodChinese* is a web based application that allows you or your students to train their Mandarin tone pronunciation. Our speech technology is based on technology developed at the [Institute of Phonetic Sciences](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/).
